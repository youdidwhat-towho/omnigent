"""E2E (UI): a cursor-native tool-approval card renders BELOW its user message.

cursor-native is terminal-first and never emits a turn lifecycle event
(``response_created``), so its approval card (``phase == "pre_tool_use"``) had no
turn to anchor to and rendered ABOVE the message that triggered it in the LIVE
stream — correct only after a page reload. This drives the real browser: send a
gated command through the web composer, wait for the ``ApprovalCard``
(``ap-web/src/components/blocks/ApprovalCard.tsx``), and assert it sits below
the user message, matching the reload layout. The regression guard for the
blockStream "standalone bubble for a no-active-turn elicitation" +
``reorderCommittedRequestElicitations`` fix.

Gated like the cursor-native render-parity suite: needs a logged-in
``cursor-agent`` and ``tmux``; skipped (not failed) otherwise — CI does not
provision a Cursor account.
