"""E2E: the rail's "+ New shell" affordance and typing into the shell.

The right rail's Shells tab shows by default whenever the session agent
declares a non-empty ``terminals:`` block — its empty state carries a
virtual "+ New shell" row (``NewTerminalButton`` in
``web/src/shell/NewTerminalButton.tsx``). With a single declared
terminal name the row creates the shell directly on click (no dropdown),
POSTing ``/resources/terminals`` and handing the new terminal's tab key
to ``onExpand``, which opens it in the main column via
``MainTerminalView``. None of this needs an LLM turn — the user, not the
agent, launches the shell — so these tests never send a chat message.

Three behaviors are covered:

1. **"+ New shell" launches and opens a shell.** Clicking the row creates
   a ``zsh`` shell and replaces the main session view with it: the
   chrome-light shell view (``MainTerminalView``'s ``isShellView``) shows
   a header naming the shell and a "Close shell" X, its xterm connects,
   and the X returns to the conversation surface.

2. **The user can type a command into the shell.** We type ``pwd`` into
   the connected shell and assert it keeps running — the keystrokes are
   accepted and the bridge does not error or close. We deliberately do
   NOT assert on the command's output: xterm renders to a WebGL canvas,
   so stdout is not in the DOM (the same reason
   ``files/test_right_panel.py`` only checks ``data-state``), and reading
   it back via a file side-effect proved environment-fragile (the shell's
   cwd and the filesystem-API root coincide locally but not on CI).

3. **The workspace rail preserves its redesigned top inset.** The rail floats
   beside the chat header at the 8px outer inset instead of clearing the
   header like the main-column surfaces.

Both use the function-scoped ``terminal_session`` fixture (registers the
``zsh``-declaring agent and a runner-bound session), so each test gets an
independent session.
