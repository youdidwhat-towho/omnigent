# Sourced by evaluate-checks.sh. These checks gate every PR. e2e, e2e-ui, and
# integration are mock-LLM (no secrets) and run on ALL PRs -- same-repo and fork
# -- directly, like CI. They are in ALLOW_SKIP too because they are legitimately
# absent in some runs: draft PRs (empty matrix) and path-ignored PRs (the
# workflow doesn't run). The real-gateway e2e-ui tests run nightly only and are
# NOT PR checks, so they are not listed here.
# Generated file -- do not hand-edit; it is replaced wholesale on every sync.
