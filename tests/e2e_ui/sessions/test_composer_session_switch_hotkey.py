"""E2E: Cmd/Ctrl+↑/↓ switches sessions even while the composer is focused.

Covers the composer fix in ``ap-web/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx``: the composer's
ArrowUp/ArrowDown draft-recall handler used to intercept *any* arrow keydown,
so the global session-switch hotkey (``useSessionSwitchHotkey``, Cmd/Ctrl+↑/↓)
appeared dead while typing — recall swallowed the keystroke and replaced the
draft instead of switching sessions. The fix gates recall to UNmodified arrows
(``!metaKey && !ctrlKey && !altKey``), letting the modified chord bubble to the
window-level hotkey.

The regression is specifically "composer has focus". So this test puts focus
in the composer (types a draft), then presses Ctrl+ArrowDown (the Win/Linux
chord; CI runs Linux chromium — the hook also accepts Cmd via metaKey on
macOS) and asserts the route navigates to a different session. Pre-fix, recall
ate the chord and the route never changed.

No LLM turn is needed — this exercises pure client-side keyboard + routing —
so it skips the nightly/real-agent markers the approval suites carry. Two
runner-bound sessions come from the ``seeded_session_pair`` fixture; both
render under the sidebar's "Chats" group, so both are in the hotkey's ordered
list.
